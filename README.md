# Mini Box of Light - Basics Working
A super lightweight basic lightbox that anyone can use

As of v0.4 it is usable but it's just the basics.

## To-Do:
* Adjust to fit images
* Stop overflow of title
* Use "data-" attribute to allow for alternate high quality images (saves data)
* Alternate theme(s)
* Animations
