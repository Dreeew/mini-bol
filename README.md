# Mini Box of Light - Basics Working
A super lightweight basic lightbox that anyone can use

As of v0.4 it is usable but it's just the basics.

## To-Do:
*Adjust to fit images
*Stop overflow of title
*Use "data-" attribute to allow for alternate high quality images (saves data by using thumbnails if other images dont need to be loaded)
*Alternate theme(s)
*Animations
