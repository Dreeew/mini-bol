# Mini Box of Light - Basics Working
A basic lightbox plugin that anyone can use!

### Why?
As a student at college (before we were taught JavaScript), we were given a project to create a website which one of the features was an image gallery - most people tried to use plugins that were complex... or just had links to images (yeah...), so I thought I'd try my hand at making a basic and super easy to use lightbox! It's basically an unordered list with a class, everything else is handled by the script.

Keep in mind it's just a little side project and very much a work in progress and therefore untested and rather messy code!

As of v0.4 it is usable but it's just the basics.

## To-Do:
* Adjust to fit images
* Stop overflow of title
* Use "data-" attribute to allow for alternate high quality images (saves data)
* Alternate theme(s)
* Animations
* Test, test test!
* Convert to plain JavaScript so no dependancy on jQuery
